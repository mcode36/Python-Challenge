It's suddenly really hot out there. Why?

By 1 p.m. Tuesday, the mercury in Santa Rosa had reached 90 degrees, the highest temperature the North Bay city has seen since the start of the year.

The heat is on in the North Bay valleys, and across the greater San Francisco Bay Area, with temperatures soaring 15 to 20 degrees above seasonal averages. The National Weather Service cautioned temperatures will inch up higher through the afternoon and will likely break same-day records.

As of 1 p.m., San Francisco was 79 degrees, Oakland 82 and Hayward, Livermore and San Jose all 84 degrees. Fairfield was a sweltering 90.

Several factors are contributing to the mini-heat streak. A strong high-pressure ridge over Northern California is blocking storm activity off the Pacific Ocean. It has also carried in a column of warm air that extends high into the atmosphere.

"Every 12 hours we release a weather balloon from the Oakland.

Airport, and this afternoon temperatures were very warm 15,000 to 20,000 feet above the ground," says Scott Rowe, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Monterey. "These temperatures were anomalously warm."

What's more, offshore winds have kicked up and are blowing hot air from the inland valleys toward the coast. The more usual onshore flow that blows cold water off the ocean has turned off.

"We're not seeing the usual offshore push that provides natural air conditioning," says Rowe.

The summery weather trend is forecast to continue Wednesday. Temperatures may drop a degree or two in the North Bay valleys and jump up in the Salinas Valley. Things will start to cool more significantly Thursday with an ocean breeze picking up.
