### Challenge 1: Multiplication Table ###

1. Print 9 x 9 Multiplication Table in one column
   for example,
   
    1  x  1  =   1
    1  x  2  =   2
    1  x  3  =   3
    1  x  4  =   4
    1  x  5  =   5
     ...
     ...
    9  x  7  =  63
    9  x  8  =  72
    9  x  9  =  81
    
    Note the number need to be right aligned.

2. Make the print out looked nicer by adding outlines to each block.
   for example,
    +---------------+
    | 1  x  1  =  1 |
    | 1  x  2  =  2 |
    | 1  x  3  =  3 |
    | 1  x  4  =  4 |
    | 1  x  5  =  5 |
    | 1  x  6  =  6 |
    | 1  x  7  =  7 |
    | 1  x  8  =  8 |
    | 1  x  9  =  9 |
    +---------------+
    | 2  x  1  =  1 |
    | 2  x  2  =  4 |
    | 2  x  3  =  6 |
        ...
        ...
    
    Note there should only be one single line between blocks.
    
3. Modify the code so that it now print the table in a 3 x 3 matrix.
   for example,
   
   1  x  1  =  1     2  x  1  =  2     3  x  1  =  3
   1  x  2  =  1     2  x  2  =  4     3  x  2  =  6
   1  x  3  =  1     2  x  3  =  6     3  x  3  =  9
     ...               ...               ...
     ...               ...               ...
   1  x  9  =  9     2  x  9  = 18     3  x  9  = 27
   
4. Now let the program take one number from keyboard input.
   Use the number to determine how many columns to print.
   for example, let the input number be assigned to variable N.
   If N = 2, the program will print 2 columns.
   If N = 3, the program will print 3 columns.
